        -Restaurants available (with capacity and hours of operation)
        -For each restaurant the following tables will exist:
            -Current Reservations
            -Past Reservations

ExpressJS Interface:
    -Command Page (Customers)
        -where all customer commands to the system are issued from
            -e.g. making a reservation
        -all data accessible for selected restaurant availability will be shown by 
         default
        -user will enter the name of the restaurant at the top of the page thus
         causing the rest of the page to become populated
            -if no such restaurants exists, an error will be displayed
    -Command Page (Staff)
        -where all staff commands to the system are issued from
            -e.g. indicating that a reservation has shown up.
    -404 Page

Input Formatting Interface:
    -Submit Reservation. (Customer)
    -See free time slots. (Customer)
    -Cancel a reservation. (Customer)
    -Re-schedule a reservation. (Customer)
    -Register a guest when guest shows up. (Staff)
    -Register a no show. (Staff)

Business Logic Interface:
    -Submit Reservation.
        -Returns success, fail, name/reservation time already used, or time 
         slot full.
    -Cancel a Reservation.
        -Returns success, fail, or reservation does not exist.
    -Re-schedule a reservation.
        -Returns success, fail, time slot full, name/reservation time already used, 
         or reservation does not exist.
    -Seats available for reservation.
        -Returns an integer representing the number of tables available at a given
         time.
    -Valid time for reservation.
        -Returns whether the time selected for a reservation is during the hours
         of operation of the restaurant in question.
    -Register when a guest shows up.
        -Makes the necessary refund and moves the reservation to the past 
         reservation table.
    -Register a no show.
        -Moves the reservation to the past reservation table.
    -Calculate refund.
        -Calculates the amount of refund to give to a user based on whether the
         user showed up or at what time the user cancelled.

Reservation Payment Handling Interface:
    -Make payment.
        -Charges a specified amount to a user.
    -Make refund.
        -Refunds a specified amount to user.

DB Logic Interface:
    -External (For use with the API):
        -Insert a Reservation.
        -Delete a Reservation.
        -Find reservation.
        -Find hours of operation.
        -Returns an object containing objects representing the days of the week
         with the hours of operation for the relevant day.
        -Find number of reservations at a given time.
        -Find free reservation slots for the day.
    -Internal (For admin use only):
        -Add restaurant.
        -Purge current reservations table (using node-cron). 

Assumptions:
    1. If a seat is empty it can be reserved.
    2. The user will be required to know the name of the restaurant they want to
       eat at.
    3. The name of the individual booking and their reservation time will serve as a 
       unique key.
    4. The input provided by the Input Formatting to the Business Logic is
       exactly what the Business Logic needs.  Developer error is not a concern.
    5. Reservations can only be made on the half hour.
    6. No show reservations are still tracked as past reservations.
    7. It is assumed that all payments/refunds attempted work in the
       sense that no power outages or other system disruptions occur during the
       processing of said payments/refunds.
    8. Days will be formatted as follows: Sunday: 0, Monday: 1, ...
    9. It is assumed restaurant names are unique.
    10. Reservations are deleted as they are registered as either a no show or as 
        in attendance.  This obviates the need for the deletion of current reservations 
        at the end of the day.
    11. It is assumed that the input received by inputFormatting.js from its caller is
        the correct type of data (i.e. number if number was expected).
    12. Restaurants have unique names.

Requirements Issues:
    1. Requirement 10 is vaguely worded and does say which reservation tables it
       wants purged at 3 am.  It is assumed that only the current reservations
       table is purged.  

Test Strategy:
    Though I am unaware of any tools in JS that allow this, though it is likely they exist,
    I would like to implement mocking for each layer of my code (e.g. HippoMocks; 
    http://www.hippomocks.com/Main_Page).  So, each of businessLogic.js,
    dbLogic.js, and reservationPaymentHandling.js would have a mock function implemented for
    each of its existing function.  This will allow for a controlled return input to be 
    passed back to the function under test, i.e. the calling function, in a manner that is
    similar to production execution as possible.

    Using these mocks, I would proceed through every function in every file and do the 
    following:
        1. Input normal use case data.
        2. Input edge case data.
        3. Input data that is known to cause a valid failure.

    For the test cases relevant to dbLogic.js, a test database would be instantiated
    for the run of the test then deleted at test completion.
    
    Once I had completed the above tests with mocks, I would run full integration tests of
    the entire system using a test database.  As above, I would run the following test 
    scenarios:
        1. Input normal use case data.
        2. Input edge case data.
        3. Input data that is known to cause a valid failure.
    
    As much as is possible, these tests would cover all known paths through the code.

    I would then create a simple web interface for this API and use it to do by-hand 
    integration of the system with ExpressJS implemented.  This would entail
    constructing a word document with test steps to ensure reproducibility.  As before,
    the tests would cover the following inputs:
        1. Input normal use case data.
        2. Input edge case data.
        3. Input data that is known to cause a valid failure.


Tasks Not Completed Due to Time Constraints and What I would Like to Do Differently:
    This task has taken significantly more time than I initially thought that it would.  
    This is likely due to my recent inexperience with MongoDB and NodeJS.  As such, 
    though I have a design and test strategy for the entire system, I have not been able
    to complete my testing and implementation of this system.  As such, I will explain all 
    tasks that I have not completed here.
    1. Testing and debugging is incomplete.  Appropriate notes have been on the testing that has been
       completed.
    2. Due to time constraints, I have been unable to implement url path routing in ExpressJS.
       If I had the time, this would be a simple matter of specifying the paths elaborated
       in the design above and having said paths call out to the relevant inputFormatting.js functions.
    3. Though I have stated in the assumptions that I assume correct data is passed in, I would really
       like to either implement a module or find a module to do type verification.  This would be used
       throughout the code in order to enfore Design by Contract between all of the functions in this
       system in order to ensure that all functions create and consume correct data.
    4. I would like to implement more database structure with Mongoose.
    5. I would like to add more logging using Winston and add some more formalized error messages
       that do not expose the internal workings of the system while providing actionable messages to
       the user.
    6. Add a full testing suite using Mocha Test and some sort of tool that can issue HTTP requests
       (for testing the ExpressJS endpoints when they are available).

       NOTE: Though this assignment is not yet fully functional, I believe that this coding assignment
             demonstrates the style of my coding in terms of structure and design.  In its current state,
             it is only a matter of time to have it completely up and running as most of the more 
             difficult implementation (dbLogic) is functioning.

Set-up and Running What Exists:
  1. Install NodeJS.
  2. Install MongoDB.
  3. Launch mongod.
  4. Launch mongo (for viewing the results of the labelled tests).
  5. Launch the Node REPL.
  6. Enter the following command into the Node REPL: var dbLogic = require("./dbLogic.js");
  7. Call the test functions in dbLogic using the object dbLogic.
